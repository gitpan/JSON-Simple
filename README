JSON-Simple version 0.01
========================

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation, http://www.json.org) is a simple to use
format for data exchange, and actually a subset of JavaScript.
JSON::Simple is a module that allows easy production of valid JSON from
complex Perl data structures, and easy parsing of JSON into such data
structures.

I started writing it out of personal discontent with the interfaces of
existing JSON modules, but also as an exercise and to see if I could do it.

Version 0.01 of this module works well, but it's Unicode handling
capabilities are somewhat lacking, so that's an area that needs some more
work.
